# docker-deploy-project
Built a multi-stage Dockerized application that dynamically scrapes a user-defined URL using Puppeteer (Node.js) and hosts the scraped content through a Python Flask web server. The project demonstrates container orchestration, browser automation, and lightweight web hostingâ€”all packed in a slim, production-ready Docker image.
